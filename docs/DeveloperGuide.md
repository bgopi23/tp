### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**<a name="main-components-of-the-architecture"></a>

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts:

* `CommandBox`
* `ResultDisplay`
* `PersonListPanel`
* `PersonDetailsPanel`
* `StatusBarFooter`

There is also a `HelpWindow` that is not always displayed and is not part of the `MainWindow`.

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### QR Code

Each client has a QR code that allows users to save their contact information to their phones easily.

![QrNewUi](images/QrNewUi.png)

Initially, we wanted to simply add a QR code to the list of persons as seen below.

![QrOldUi](images/QrOldUi.png)

However, we found that in practice, the QR codes were difficult to scan for two main reasons:

1. The QR codes themselves were too small
1. The QR codes of other contacts was interfering with the one we wanted to scan

Thus, we decided to move the QR code to its own separate part of the UI.

#### QR Code Generation

Whenever a new client is added to the address book, a QR code is generated for them that contains their information in a vCard format.

The following sequence diagram illustrates this.

![QrAddPersonSequenceDiagram](images/QrAddPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

We considered generating the QR code upon the creation of a `Person` object. However, we discovered that it was possible for a `Person` to be created, but never added to the address book, as shown in the following activity diagram.

![AddCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

Thus, we chose to only generate QR codes when the person is successfully added to avoid unnecessary QR code generations.

This approach was also taken for the editing/deleting of QR codes.

#### QR Code Image File Naming

QR codes associated with a client are saved in the `data/qrcodes` folder as `.png` files, and named according to the following format:

* [HASHCODE].png, where [HASHCODE] is the result of the `hashCode()` function of a `Person`.

### Deleting a client from FitBook

The activity diagram below illustrates what happens when a client is deleted from `FitBook`.

![DeleteCommandActivityDiagram](images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Additional user details in FitBook
On top of what AB3 has to offer, FitBook allows users to add additional details to each client to better track their health status. Some key features include:

* [Note](#note-feature-in-fitbook)
* [Weight tracking feature](#weight-tracking-feature)
* [Height](#height-value-of-a-client)

#### Note feature in FitBook
The `note` feature allows users to add any relevant health information to each client.

For more details on how the `note` field interacts with the `add` and `edit` command, refer [here](#adding-or-editing-a-client).

##### Interacting with the `note` command

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other when the user inputs the command `note 1 Likes to eat`.

![AddNoteSequenceDiagram](images/AddNoteSequenceDiagram.png)

The diagram highlights the four main components of FitBook, highlighted in their respective colors. For more information regarding the four main components, see [Main components of the architecture](#main-components-of-the-architecture).

> The above sequence diagram also applies to the removal of a note from an existing client when no input string or prefix is entered for the `note` command. (i.e. `note 1`).

#### Weight tracking feature
The weight tracking feature allows users to keep track of past weight measurements of a client. You may refer to the [parameter constraints](#parameter-constraints) for more information.

We can refer to the sequence diagram [above](#interacting-with-the-note-command) to see how the addition of such fields to clients interact with the components of FitBook.

For more details on how the `weight` field interacts with the `add` and `edit` commands, refer [here](#adding-or-editing-a-client).

The activity diagram below illustrates what happens when a user enters a `weight` command.
![WeightCommandActivityDiagram](images/WeightCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Height value of a client
The `height` feature allows users to track a client's height. Since a client's height typically remains constant, we decided not to implement `height` as a trackable value (unlike [weight](#weight-tracking-feature)).

* You may refer to the [parameter constraints](#parameter-constraints) for more information.

The `height` field is similar to `note` field, except that the underlying data type is a `Float`, instead of a `String`.

We can refer to the sequence diagram [here](#interacting-with-the-note-command) to see how the addition of such fields to clients interact with the components of FitBook.

For more details on how the `height` field interacts with the `add` and `edit` commands, refer [here](#adding-or-editing-a-client).

### Finding Clients
Searching of clients is done using the `find` command. The command has been designed to be extendable, allowing for developers to easily define how new fields (attributes) in the clients can be searched.

The sequence diagram below shows the logic flow of executing the command `find n/wendy`.

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

Note that the main searching logic is defined by creating a `Predicate` (`NameContainsSubstringPredicate` in this example), which in turn calls the `isMatch()` method of the attribute.

`CombinedPredicates` is then used to allow for finding clients using multiple fields. Clients will only be matched if it passes the test for all specified `SearchPredicates` in `CombinedPredicates`. This is defined in the `FindCommandParser` class.

#### Defining new methods of finding clients
All attributes of a `Person` has been abstracted into an `Attribute` class. This `Attribute` class defines an abstract `isMatch()` method, thus, any attributes of a `Person` (new or existing), would be required to implement the `isMatch()` method to define how the attribute can be searched using the `find` command.

This is what allows the `find` command to be extendable to any attribute of a `Person`. Each attribute can be defined to be searched in different ways. For example, searching a person's `Name` would test a substring against the `Name` attribute, searching a person's `Weight` would test the `Weight` attribute against a range specified (i.e `isMatch()` will return `true` if the person's weight falls within the specified range).

Therefore, to define how an attribute is being searched, one would simply take the following steps:
1. Define the implementation of the `isMatch()` method of the respective attribute. (e.g `Name::isMatch()`)
1. Create a new class that extends `SearchPredicate` (e.g `NameContainsSubstringPredicate`)
1. Update the `parse()` method in `FindCommandParser` to uses the new predicate

#### Implementation Rationale
We believe that filtering clients is one of the most important features of the application. With a large number of clients in the application, this feature will allow users to easily filter clients based on any information they have saved.

Additionally, users have different requirements when searching for a client in FitBook. For example, some might simply wish to filter clients to by name, while others might wish to filter all clients within a certain weight range. This implementation of the `find` command provides flexibility to the user.

For developers, the usage of the `SearchPredicate` and `CombinedPredicates` class, along with the enforcing of the `isMatch()` method within each attribute simplifies the process of defining how each attribute can be searched. Existing search methods can be easily modified by changing the implementation of the `isMatch()` method within the attribute while guaranteeing new attributes to be searchable as well.

#### Alternative Implementation
An alternative implementation of the `find` command was to simply create a `Predicate` for each attribute, defining the search methodology within the predicate itself.

While this might be a simpler implementation, it has many restrictions such as:
* Developers are required to have in-depth knowledge of how `Predicates` work.
* Newly defined attributes are not guaranteed to be searchable since defining a `Predicate` for that attribute cannot be enforced.
* Higher chance of regression of find feature if developer fails to properly integrate new and existing `Predicates`.
* Messier code base.

Due to the reasons stated above, we decided that the current implementation of the find command using the `SearchPredicate` class and `isMatch()` methods to better fit our vision for the feature, providing greater functionality to users while simplifing the development process for developers.

### Adding or editing a client

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a client is added or edited in FitBook.

![AddAndEditCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddAndEditCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Adding, editing or deleting exercises for a client
FitBook enables our target user (personal trainers) to add, edit and delete custom exercises for each of their clients.
The management of these custom exercises is performed using the `fitadd` and `fitdelete` commands.

An exercise consists of a name, number of sets, number of reps and break time between sets (in seconds).

![ClientExercises](images/ClientExercises.png)

#### Storing exercises

A great deal of consideration was made regarding how the custom exercises should be stored for each client.

The following data structures were taken into consideration during the brainstorming and design process.

1. ArrayList
1. Plain JSON without deserialization
1. Java Set

The following factors were taken into consideration when selecting a suitable data structure.

- The requirement to store multiple exercises
- The requirement to easily detect duplicate exercises
- The requirement to flexibly modify the logic for detecting duplicate exercises

Upon listing out our requirements, we found that Java `HashSet` to be the most suitable one because it implements the Java `Set` interface.
Apart from this, the `Set` interface exposes the `contains` method to check for duplicates.

#### Detecting duplicate exercises

Another point of consideration was with regard to how we should determine whether two exercises belonging to the same client
are considered duplicates since an exercise has multiple fields.

To keep it simple for our initial iterations, we decided to only use lower-cased exercise names to determine duplicates.
However, this may change in the future. For example, the same exercise may have different numbers of sets, reps, and break times for different
days of the week. To modify the detection of duplicate exercises, we can simply modify the logic for the `equals` method
in our `Exercise` class, this is made possible because of our decision to store the exercises in a Java `Set`.

### Specialised error messages for commands
When typing in commands, error messages guide the user on what is missing or wrong with their command format.

Let's take the `add` command as an example.

The correct format is as follows : `add n/NAME p/PHONE`

|    Command    |           Error Message           |
|:-------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|     `add`     |    _No parameters specified!_     |
| `add n/NAME`  | _Phone number parameter missing!_ |
| `add p/PHONE` |     _Name parameter missing!_     |
|  `add NAME`   |     _Invalid command format!_     |

Now lets look at the `delete` command for another example

The correct format is as follows : `delete INDEX`

|   Command    |                        Error Message                         |
|:------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   `delete`   |                    _No index specified!_                     |
| `delete two` |                  _Invalid index provided!_                   |
|   `delet`    | _Unknown command, please type 'help' for possible commands!_ |
| `delete -1`  |                  _Invalid index provided!_                   |


**_How the feature was implemented._** <br>
The specialised error messages was implemented by improving the parsing of commands in the respective
command parsers (AddCommandParser, DeleteCommandParser).

**_Why it is implemented that way._** <br>
We anticipated possible erroneous user inputs and crafted specialised outputs as we wanted to prompt the user in a
certain direction towards the correct command format instead of just telling them the format was wrong.

**_Alternatives considered._** <br>
Alternatives such as hyper-specific error outputs were considered, but ultimately, we felt that the benefit it would add
was trivial.

![SpecialisedErrorMessages](images/SpecialisedErrorMessagesDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th client in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new client. The `add` command also
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into
the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the client being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

<a id="nfr-1"></a>

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ (Windows, macOS and Linux) as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
1. Should be able to hold up to 1000 clients without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
1. Should provide responsive performance, users should experience minimal delays in critical functionalities such as searching and updating contacts (feedback should be within 1 second).
1. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
1. Should provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Users should be able to easily and quickly navigate the user interface to identify crucial information (E.g Name, Contact, Health information) at a glance.
1. Should have a shallow learning curve. New users (including the non-technically savvy) should be able to pick up and start using the application efficiently within a week.
1. Should be optimized to run smoothly on low-end devices with limited processing power and memory. Users on older hardware should be able to use the application as long as it meets [this requirement](#nfr-1).

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

FitBook's team size is 5.

1. **Allow for more flexible weight management**

    The current implementation of tracking clients' weights only allows users to add, modify or delete the latest weight value at the current date and time. We plan to make this feature more flexible by allowing users to add/modify a client's weight at a specified date and time of their choice.

1. **Provide more specific error messages**

    When removing optional fields of a client, we should provide more detailed error messages. This is currently only available for the `weight` field, where removing a weight value from a client that has no weight value associated with them prompts the error message, `There are no more weight values to be removed. This client has no more weight values associated with them.`. We plan to provide more specific error messages when a client edits a field that has not changed / has nothing to remove, where the error message will be similar to the one seen in the `weight` field.

1. **Always display details of client being modified**

    To improve clarity for users, the details pane should always show the information of the client that is being modified/had just been modified.

    > Some examples where this could be implemented:
    >
    > * Modifying exercises using `fitadd` changes the tab back to weight, if there is a weight tab. It should show the exercises tab.
    > * Using `note 1 /edit` while client 2 is selected would edit client 1's note, but the details pane still shows client 2.

1. **Better keyboard navigation support**

    For advanced users, we can provide a better keyboard navigation experience by making the element being selected with `Tab` clearer. We also plan to remove unnecessary `Tab` presses between elements of interest. e.g. to get from the command input box to the client list requires 2 `Tab`s even though the user cannot interact with the result response box.

1. **Adaptive client list entries**

    The client list will always show the most important information at a glance. To reduce clutter, each entry of the client list will only show the following fields, each in a single line.
      * Name
      * Tags
      * Phone Number

    Fields that exceed the length of the line would be truncated. Complete information can always be viewed in the client details panel.

1. **Restrict the number of weight entries per day to 1**

    Since a client's weight won't change much within a day, we can restrict the number of weight entries per day to 1. Having multiple weight entries within a day would also distort the weight-tracking graph.

1. **Allow names containing non-alphanumeric characters**

    Clients may have non-English names, or whose legal names contain non-alphanumeric characters. We should allow users to enter names that contain non-alphanumeric characters to make FitBook more inclusive.
    
1. **Implement usage of escape characters to allow input of prefixes into certain fields**

    Users might want to enter text in certain fields (e.g. `note`, `address`) that coincide with the prefixes for other attributes. For example, `add n/Tom p/123 a/LazyTown p/o box number 999` is currently not allowed as `p/` in `p/o` is treated as a prefix for phone number. Hence, we intend to implement the usage of escape characters to allow for such inputs.
