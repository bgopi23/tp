## Setting up FitBook

1. Ensure you have Java **11** or above installed.
    * [What version of Java do I have?](#what-version-of-java-do-i-have)
    * Need help installing Java? Check out the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html" target="_blank">Java 11 installation guide</a>.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:question: **What is Java? Is it safe to install?**

Java is a versatile programming language used for developing various applications. FitBook requires it to be installed because it is written in Java and relies on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to run.

<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/whatis_java.html" target="_blank">Learn more about Java</a>.
</div>

[//]: # (Continue numbering from 2, as the block above interrupts the list and resets the number)

{:start="2"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Launches the help menu depicted below. <br>
Clicking `Open User Guide` leads to the User Guide website.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)
Format: `help`

<hr>

### Adding a client : `add`

Adds a client to the FitBook.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [w/WEIGHT] [h/HEIGHT] [nt/NOTE] [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:**
A client can have 0 or more tags.
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@gmail.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 nt/john from school`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@hotmail.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 nt/likes donuts t/criminal`

<hr>

### Listing all clients : `list`

Displays an indexed list of all clients in FitBook.

Format: `list`
<hr>

### Editing a client : `edit`

Edits information tagged to an existing client.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [w/WEIGHT] [h/HEIGHT] [nt/NOTE] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the clients at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When no value is specified after a prefix, the value of that prefix will be removed from the client. (e.g. `edit 1 nt/` removes the note from the client at index 1).
    * Since WEIGHT can store multiple historical values, specifying an empty weight prefix removes the latest weight value from the client. Otherwise, the latest weight value will be replaced by the specified weight in this command.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the client will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the client’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st client to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd client to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
<hr>

### Adding a note to a client : `note`

Format: `note INDEX [NOTE] `

* Edits the note of the client specified by `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Existing note will be updated to the note specified.
* If no note is given, the note for the client at the specified index will be deleted.

> While this can also be done using the `edit` command, this `note` command serves as a faster way for users to directly modify a note.

Examples:

* `note 1 History of asthma` - Changes the note of the 1st client to `History of asthma`.
* `note 2 Previously sprained both ankles` - Changes the note of the 2nd client to `Previously sprained both ankles`.

If `/edit` is supplied instead of a note, (e.g. `note 1 /edit`), the contents of the command box will be replaced with a note command whose NOTE field is pre-loaded with the note of the client at the specified index.

> For example: Client at index 1 has the note "Wants to gain muscle".
>
> Executing the command `note 1 /edit` will replace the contents of the command box with `note 1 Wants to gain muscle`.
<hr>

### Adding or overriding exercise(s) of clients : `fitadd`

Format: `fitadd INDEX n/EXERCISE_NAME [s/SETS] [r/REPS] [b/BREAK_BETWEEN_SETS_IN_SECONDS]`

* Adds the specified exercise(s) to the client specified by `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* If an exercise with same name already exists for the client, the old exercise will be overwritten with the newly supplied field values, or a default set of values (sets: 1, reps: 1, break: 0) if not supplied.

Alternatively, you can use any one of the supported prefixes to quickly add a predefined set of related exercises to the specified client.

Format: `fitadd INDEX [/arms] [/legs] [/chest] [/back] [/shoulders] [/abs] [/all]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Warning**

You must either specify a specific exercise name or use a number of default supported prefixes, but not both together.
</div>

Examples:

* `fitadd 1 n/burpees` - Adds or overwrites the `burpees` exercise of the 1st client with a default set of 1, repetition of 1 and 0 seconds break time between sets.
* `fitadd 1 n/burpees s/3 r/5 b/30` - Adds or overwrites the `burpees` exercise of the 1st client with sets of 3, repetitions of 5 and 30 seconds break time between sets.
* `fitadd 2 /arms` - Adds or overwrites a default set of exercises from the `arms` category to the 2nd client.
* `fitadd 2 /arms /legs` - Adds or overwrites a default set of exercises from the `arms` and `legs` category to the 2nd client.
<hr>

### Deleting exercise(s) of clients : `fitdelete`

Format: `fitdelete INDEX n/EXERCISE_NAME [/all]`

* Deletes the specified exercises(s) from the client specified by `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Supplying the `/all` prefix deletes all exercise(s) from the specified client.
 
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Warning**

You must either specify a specific exercise name or the `/all` prefix, but not both together.
</div>

Examples:

* `fitdelete 1 n/burpees` - Deletes the exercise with name `burpees` from the 1st client.
* `fitdelete 2 /all` - Deletes all exercise(s) from the 2nd client.
<hr>

### Adding a weight value to a client : `weight`

Format: `weight INDEX [WEIGHT] `

* Adds a weight value to a client specified by `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Weight values specified in this command will be added as a new weight value to the specified client. To edit the latest weight of the client, use the [`edit`](#editing-a-client--edit) command.
* If no weight value is given, the latest weight for the client at the specified index will be deleted.

> While the `edit` command allows one to **edit** a client's latest weight value, this `weight` command serves as a way for users to **add** a client's weight.

Examples:

* `weight 1 90` - Adds a new weight value of 90 to the client at index 1.
* `weight 2` - Deletes the latest weight value of the client at index 2.

### Searching clients : `find`

Finds all clients that match the specified attributes.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [w/RANGE] [h/RANGE] [nt/NOTE] [t/TAG]…​`

* The search is case-insensitive for inputs that accept characters (i.e. `NAME, PHONE, EMAIL, ADDRESS, NOTE, TAG`). e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* `RANGE` allows the user to search for a value that falls within the specified `RANGE`. The syntax is as follows:
    * `FROM, TO`. For example, to search for weights that fall between 70kg and 90kg, you can enter `w/70, 90`.
* Any fields specified in the format above can be searched.
* When an empty input is specified an optional field, only users that have value(s) available for that field will be showed. (e.g. `find w/` returns all clients that have at least one weight value associated to them).
* Multiple fields can be searched in one command.
    * All fields must match (e.g `find n/Wendy p/91234567` will match with a contact whose name **contains** `wendy` and phone number **contains** `91234567`)
* All fields except `TAG` will be matched based on substring (e.g `Wen` will match `Wendy`)
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Take note:**
* Unlike other fields, `TAG` must be an exact match (case-insensitive)
* E.g `find t/fri` will not match the tag `friend`
* But `find t/fRieNd` will match the tag `friend`
</div>


Examples:
* `find n/Wendy` returns `Wendy Son` and `Wendy Kim`
* `find n/Wendy t/Lover` returns `Wendy` (`Name` contains `Wendy` and is tagged with `Lover`)

<hr>

### Deleting a client : `delete`

Deletes the specified client from FitBook.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the client at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list.
* The index **must be a single positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3…​).
* Anything after `delete` is treated as the index.
* The index cannot be followed by any text.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the second client in the list.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the first client in the results of the `find` command.
* `delete 1 2` will be regarded as an invalid index.

<hr>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all client information from FitBook.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">
:rotating_light: **This command is irreversible. Use with caution.**
</div>

If you are sure of your decision to clear all client information, use the `/confirm` prefix with this command to execute it.

Format: `clear /confirm`

<hr>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits FitBook.

Format: `exit`
<hr>

### Saving the data

FitBook data is saved to your hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.

<hr>

### Editing the data file

FitBook data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Warning:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, FitBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file before editing it.

Furthermore, certain edits can cause FitBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range, or an invalid field is specified). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>
<hr>
